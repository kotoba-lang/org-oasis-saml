;; `kotoba/saml/acceptance.kotoba` -- the service provider's side of a Web
;; SSO exchange.
;;
;; ## There is no oracle, and that is the finding
;;
;; `saml.core` emits. Its README puts XML-DSig and inbound parsing outside
;; the library, and `parse-attributes` says the host hands back an EDN
;; assertion "after it has parsed and VERIFIED" one. A signature says the
;; IdP minted the assertion; it does not say the IdP minted it for THIS
;; service provider, for THIS login attempt, to be delivered HERE, and that
;; it is valid NOW.
;;
;; `the-acceptance-decision-has-no-home-in-the-library` enumerates the
;; public API and shows that no function takes an assertion and an
;; expectation. That is a measurement, not a claim: if such a function is
;; added, the test fails and someone has to decide which one is the
;; decision.
;;
;; ## The emitter cannot produce an assertion a correct SP would accept
;;
;; Web SSO Profile §4.1.4.2: a bearer assertion MUST carry a
;; `<SubjectConfirmation Method="...bearer">` whose
;; `<SubjectConfirmationData>` names `Recipient`, `NotOnOrAfter`, and
;; `InResponseTo` for a solicited response. `saml.core/assertion` emits a
;; `<Subject>` containing a `<NameID>` and nothing else --
;; `an-emitted-assertion-carries-no-subject-confirmation` reads the hiccup
;; the library itself produced and shows the element is absent. An IdP
;; built on this library emits assertions that a service provider doing its
;; job has to reject, and the guest is what does the rejecting.
;;
;; The positive cases are built with `saml.core/response` and
;; `saml.core/assertion` and read back out of the hiccup, so the shape the
;; guest is driven with is the shape this library actually emits, not one
;; the test invented.
